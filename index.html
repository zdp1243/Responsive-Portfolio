        <p style="color:#666666; text-indent:40px; font-size:16px; padding:0%">I am an aspiring full-stack web-developer.  I have had a rather non-traditional career path thus far, in that I am a bit of a Jack of All Trades.  I have lived in four countries, and 
                have had to be innovative to find work.  Every new path has been a "trial by fire", but it has taught me how to think on my feet and be flexible. I hold an MSc in Biomolecular 
                Archaeology from the University of Sheffield (UK), and worked for an archaeological survey company in Ireland.  When I returned to the US, I worked for Virginia
                Commonwealth University--initially sequencing pathogen genomes, then later researching apoptotic mechanisms in gastric and colon cancer.  I was well published in 
                both archaeological and scientific journals. I am also a published fiction author and illustrator. I look forward to utilizing my varied skill-set in my projects as a web-developer.

            <p style="color:#666666; text-indent:40px; font-size:16px; padding:0%;">Please feel free to contact me through the form or the media links provided. I would be happy to discuss
                my portfolio with you, and any potiential web-development projects you are interested in having developed. </p>
